Repository for the Sun\* internal **Agentic Coding** hands-on workshop. Participants will use **MoMorph + Claude Code** to generate code from Figma designs. Besides Claude Code, you can also use other AI coding agents such as **Copilot**, **Gemini**, **Windsurf**, etc. with similar steps and usage. In this hands-on, we assume you are using **Claude Code**.

## Branches

This repository has 2 branches:

- [**`main`**](https://github.com/sun-asterisk-internal/agentic-coding-hands-on/tree/main) — Initial source code. Participants clone this repository and work on this branch. You will need to install MoMorph CLI and run `momorph init` to generate the `.claude`, `.vscode` directories (containing prompts) to connect with the MoMorph MCP Server.
- [**`sample`**](https://github.com/sun-asterisk-internal/agentic-coding-hands-on/tree/sample) — Contains pre-built `.claude`, `.vscode`, `.momorph` directories with sample specs for several screens. Use this as a reference to see what the input context and MoMorph-generated output look like.

## Hands-on Guide

### Step 0: Complete GitHub SSO

1. Visit https://github.com/orgs/sun-asterisk-internal/sso
2. Complete the SSO sign-in process so your GitHub account can join the `sun-asterisk-internal` organization
3. Send your GitHub username to `@nguyen.huu.kim` or `@le.minh.hoang` so you can be added to the `sun-asterisk-internal/agentic-coding-hands-on` repository members list
4. Wait for confirmation, then proceed to the next step

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sun-asterisk-internal/agentic-coding-hands-on.git
cd agentic-coding-hands-on
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```sh
# Create .env file:
cp .env.example .env

# Install packages:
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Sign in to MoMorph Web and connect your GitHub account

1. Go to [MoMorph Web](https://momorph.ai/) and sign in with your Figma account (use your `*@sun-asterisk.com` email).
2. Enter the following Figma file link to continue: https://www.figma.com/design/9ypp4enmFmdK3YAFJLIu6C/SAA-2025---Internal-Live-Coding
3. Go to **Settings → GitHub → Connect** to link your GitHub account with MoMorph, and make sure you have granted access to the `sun-asterisk-internal/agentic-coding-hands-on` repository in this step.

> **Note:** This repository is already connected to MoMorph and the Figma project on the system. You only need to connect your personal GitHub account to MoMorph to get started.

### Step 4: Set git remote to point to the correct repository

Ensure the local repo's git remote points to the original repository:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/sun-asterisk-internal/agentic-coding-hands-on.git
```

This is necessary for the MoMorph VSCode Extension to recognize the repository and display the linked Figma file.

### Step 5: Install MoMorph CLI

Choose one of the following installation methods:

```sh
# macOS / Linux (Homebrew):
brew install momorph/tap/momorph-cli

# Windows (Chocolatey):
choco install momorph

# Windows (PowerShell):
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/momorph/cli/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex

# Linux / macOS (Bash):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/momorph/cli/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
momorph version
```

### Step 6: Sign in to MoMorph CLI

```sh
momorph login
```

The CLI will display an authentication code and a login link. Press `Enter` to open the link in your browser, then enter the code to complete authentication.

Check your account information:

```sh
momorph whoami
```

### Step 7: Initialize the MoMorph project

Run the init command to generate configuration directories (`.claude`, `.vscode` prompts, MCP server connection, etc.):

```sh
# For Claude Code:
momorph init . --ai claude

# For GitHub Copilot:
momorph init . --ai copilot

# For Cursor:
momorph init . --ai cursor
```

This command will:
- Download the latest MoMorph project template
- Generate configuration files (`.claude/`, prompt files, workflow scripts, etc.)
- Set up the MCP server connection for the selected AI agent
- Automatically install the MoMorph VSCode Extension (if not already installed). After installation, open the repo source code in VSCode → run the "MoMorph: Sign In" command → click on the MoMorph icon in the sidebar → you will see the frame list of the linked Figma file.

### Step 8: Start generating code

Use the Figma project for practice:

**Figma file:** [SAA 2025 - Internal Live Coding](https://www.figma.com/design/9ypp4enmFmdK3YAFJLIu6C/SAA-2025---Internal-Live-Coding)

#### Preparing context: Writing Screen Specs on MoMorph Web

Normally, before starting code generation, you need to prepare complete *Screen Specifications* on MoMorph. Screen Specifications can be written manually, generated by AI through features on MoMorph Web, the MoMorph Figma Plugin (requires a Figma Account with Full Seat), or through Agent systems (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code) when connected to the MoMorph MCP Server.

Screen specs on the server are the source of truth for the entire code generation workflow.

> **Note for this hands-on session:** Screen specs for all screens have already been prepared on the MoMorph server, so you **do not need to create screen specs** and can **jump straight into the code generation workflow starting from `/momorph.constitution`**. However, you are still encouraged to explore the Screen Spec creation process with MoMorph in more depth.
> - Please refer to the [MoMorph Figma Plugin](https://sun-asterisk.enterprise.slack.com/docs/T02CQGZA7MK/F07S87PSVUN) documentation to learn more about writing Screen Specs.
> - Please refer to the [MoMorph CLI Commands](https://sun-asterisk.enterprise.slack.com/docs/T02CQGZA7MK/F0A86NC88SK) documentation, then try creating screen specs for a few screens using the `momorph.specs` command.

#### Code generation workflow with MoMorph

Once screen specs are available on the MoMorph server, use slash commands in your AI agent to generate code:

1. **`/momorph.constitution`** — Initialize coding standards and conventions for the project. This is a command you typically only need to run once at the beginning of the workflow to establish the development rules that the AI Agent must follow throughout the code generation process.
2. **`/momorph.specify`** — Fetch screen specs and Figma design information to local via MoMorph MCP, then analyze and generate detailed specification files (`spec.md`, `design-style.md`). For each feature/screen, start with this command to establish the initial context.
3. **`/momorph.reviewspecify`** — Review and refine the spec output (recommended to run 2–3 times for better results)
4. **`/momorph.plan`** — Generate a detailed implementation plan
5. **`/momorph.reviewplan`** — Review and refine the plan output (recommended to run 2–3 times for better results)
6. **`/momorph.tasks`** — Break down the plan into an executable task list
7. **`/momorph.implement`** — Execute tasks, generate code and tests

> **Why do we still need to run `/momorph.specify` even though specs already exist on MoMorph?**
>
> - **Screen specs on the MoMorph server** are functional descriptions of behavior and business logic written by humans and stored on the MoMorph Web platform. They serve as the source of truth.
> - **`/momorph.specify`** reads those screen specs from the server, **combines them with design information from Figma (layout, styles, component structure, etc.)**, and synthesizes them into detailed spec files stored locally in the repo (`spec.md`, `design-style.md`). These files are the direct context used by the AI agent in subsequent steps (plan, tasks, implement).
>
> In other words: specs on the MoMorph server are **screen specs** in Sun\*'s format, written for humans to read and review. The output of `/momorph.specify` is an **implementation spec** synthesized from multiple sources — **processed and enriched context** that enables the AI Agent to understand and generate accurate code.

#### Example prompts for each command

**1. `/momorph.constitution`** — Create development rules to follow in the project:

```
/momorph.constitution Write clean code with clear, concise source code organization. Apply best practices with Next.js, Cloudflare Workers, and Supabase. The application must also be responsive and support compatibility across different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. Additionally, adhere to OWASP secure coding standards.
```

**2. `/momorph.specify`** — Create local specs and synthesize Figma design information:

```
/momorph.specify Create specs for the following Login screen:
https://momorph.ai/files/Z9KFZ0aAoOfkVEIPuwwkZl/frames/662:14387
```

**3. `/momorph.reviewspecify`** — Review the generated specs:

```
/momorph.reviewspecify Review specs for the following Login screen:
https://momorph.ai/files/Z9KFZ0aAoOfkVEIPuwwkZl/frames/662:14387
```

> It is recommended to run this command 2–3 times for more thorough spec reviews.

**4. `/momorph.plan`** — Create an implementation plan:

```
/momorph.plan Using Supabase Auth + Next.js + Cloudflare. Create a development plan for the Login screen:
https://momorph.ai/files/Z9KFZ0aAoOfkVEIPuwwkZl/frames/662:14387
```

**5. `/momorph.reviewplan`** — Review the generated plan:

```
/momorph.reviewplan Review the plan for the Login screen:
https://momorph.ai/files/Z9KFZ0aAoOfkVEIPuwwkZl/frames/662:14387
```

> It is recommended to run this command 2–3 times for more thorough plan reviews.

**6. `/momorph.tasks`** — Break the plan into a task list:

```
/momorph.tasks Break down the development tasks for the Login screen:
https://momorph.ai/files/Z9KFZ0aAoOfkVEIPuwwkZl/frames/662:14387
```

**7. `/momorph.implement`** — Execute tasks, generate code:

```
/momorph.implement Proceed to develop the Login screen:
https://momorph.ai/files/Z9KFZ0aAoOfkVEIPuwwkZl/frames/662:14387
```

**8. Fix bugs after all tasks are implemented:**

It is recommended to continue using the `/momorph.implement` command to fix bugs:
```
/momorph.implement Add a task to fix the incorrect font in the footer. Please review all items to ensure the fonts match the design.
```

### Step 9: Run the development server

```sh
# Start local containers:
make up

# Run dev server:
make dev

# Stop containers:
make down
```
